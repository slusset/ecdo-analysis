## **Step 0 — Declare the scientific posture (explicitly)**

You are **not** trying to prove ECDO.

You are testing whether **Earth system observables show anomalous coupling inconsistent with known processes**.

Write this at the top of your notebook (seriously).

* * *

## **Step 1 — The Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

Here is a **precise, falsifiable null** you can defend:




> **H₀:******

> _After accounting for known atmospheric–oceanic angular momentum exchange and established oscillatory modes (seasonal
cycle, ENSO-scale variability, Chandler wobble), variations in Earth rotation (LOD) and global seismic moment release
are statistically independent beyond short-term stochastic correlations.___




Plain English:

* LOD is driven by AAM/OAM exchange

* Seismic moment release is governed by tectonic stress accumulation

* Any apparent correlation is:

    * transient

    * non-stationary

    * explainable by known coupling

    * or an artifact of smoothing / endpoint bias

* * *

## **Step 2 — What would reject H₀ (this matters)**

You only reject the null if **all** of these are true:

1. **Persistent correlation******

    * LOD ↔ seismic moment correlation persists across decades

    * Survives rolling-window analysis

2. **Orthogonality survives******

    * Correlation remains after controlling for AAM

    * i.e., not explainable as atmosphere-driven LOD variance

3. **Low smoothing dependence******

    * Signal exists without aggressive low-pass filtering

4. **Out-of-sample robustness******

    * Relationship appears pre-2000 as well as post-2000

If any of these fail → H₀ stands.

This is a high bar by design.

* * *

## **Step 3 — Define variables**

## **before loading data**

Write this down first:

### **Independent variables**

* **LOD(t)** — monthly mean, ms

* **AAM(t)** — monthly mean, dimensionless or SI-normalized

### **Dependent variable**

* **ΣM₀(t)** — summed seismic moment per month (Nm)

### **Controls**

* Seasonal cycle (removed explicitly)

* ENSO proxy (optional, later)

* * *

## **Step 4 — What you are not testing yet**

Do **not** include:

* population, biosphere, finance, volcanism

* polar drift narratives

* short-window “acceleration” plots

Those are phase-2 temptations.

* * *

## **Step 5 — The first plots (when you get there)**

Only **three plots** are allowed initially:

1. Raw monthly LOD (1962–present)

2. Raw monthly seismic moment release

3. Rolling correlation (e.g., 10-year window) between them

No composites. No normalization gymnastics.

* * *

## **Step 6 — Why this is powerful**

If you **fail** to reject H₀:

* You’ve done real science

* You’ve learned where narrative amplification enters

* You can still use this knowledge for risk framing

If you **reject** H₀:

* You have something legitimately anomalous

* Stronger than any X thread

* Worth deeper investigation

Either outcome is valuable.
