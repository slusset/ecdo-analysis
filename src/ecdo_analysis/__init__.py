ECDO Analysis Package

Statistical analysis of Earth system observables:
- Length of Day (LOD) variations
- Atmospheric Angular Momentum (AAM)
- Seismic moment release

This package provides utilities for testing the null hypothesis that
LOD and seismic moment release are statistically independent beyond
short-term stochastic correlations.
